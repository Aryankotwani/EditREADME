1) Build a circuit with 4 inputs and 2 outputs.  Assume the inputs are called in3, in2, in1, in0 or are declared "[3:0]in" {Verilog}.  Similarly, the outputs are called o1 and o0 or "[1:0]o" {Verilog}.  

2) Output o1 turns on when there are an odd number for the 4 inputs (1 or 3 of them are on).  Output o0 turns on when the superset of {o1 and the 4 inputs} have at least 3 values turned on (for example, for the five signals if o1 = 1, in[3] = 0, in[2] = 1, in[1] = 1, in[0] = 1 would turn on the circuit).
